              "' O setor de IA está aquecido e o salário para quem domina essa tecnologia pode variar entre R$ 5 mil e R$ 16 mil, segundo uma plataforma de emprego.  No entanto, muitas empresas têm dificuldade para contratar profissionais qualificados que sabem lidar com essa tecnologia.  O g1 conversou com três jovens que já trabalham com IA e eles contam como tem sido atuar nesse ramo que ganhou ainda mais relevância há dois anos.  Camilly Alves, Heinz Felipe e Heloisy Pereira. O que estes três brasileiros com menos de 30 anos têm em comum? Eles decidiram largar suas áreas \"dos sonhos\" para apostar em um ramo novo e que não dominavam: inteligência artificial (IA).  Mudar a rota para investir na IA foi a melhor decisão possível, afirmam. Dois deles decidiram abandonar a medicina para tentar trabalhar no setor, que está aquecido.  Muitas empresas estão investindo nessa inovação e são poucas as pessoas que realmente têm o domínio dessa tecnologia.  A média salarial para a área no Brasil está entre R$ 5 mil e R$ 16 mil, segundo a plataforma de emprego Glassdoor. Os valores foram levantados até abril de 2024 e a plataforma não especifica se considera contratos CLT e PJ.  Segundo Heloisy, considerada a primeira mulher bacharel em IA no Brasil, pessoas da sua turma que cursaram graduação em IA estão ganhando em média de R$ 7 mil a R$ 10 mil por mês. Alguns tem até trabalhado para empresas de fora do Brasil.  Os profissionais ouvidos pelo g1 contam como foi entrar na área, como a família encarou essa decisão e como tem sido trabalhar nesse setor (leia os relatos a seguir).  🧠 Nesta reportagem, você verá:  A goiana Heloisy Pereira Rodrigues, de 24 anos, sempre teve interesse por medicina. Em 2018, ela chegou a fazer um semestre de odontologia na Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), mas logo desistiu porque, no fim, não era o que ela realmente curtia.  No entanto, tudo mudou em 2019, quando ela foi à colação de grau da sua irmã, também na UFG. Ali, o reitor da universidade comentou da criação do curso de inteligência artificial e disse que logo as vagas para a primeira turma estariam abertas.  Após fazer cursinho e ter prestado o Enem, ela também se inscreveu no Sisu para cursar IA. \"Antes, eu fui atrás para saber o que era isso e vi que o mercado de trabalho estava altamente aquecido. A área de afinidade era exatas, que é uma coisa que eu gosto. Então, segui com essa opção\".  Já no primeiro semestre, com o programa de parceria da Universidade junto de empresas privadas, a jovem conseguiu ganhar R$ 1 mil em um projeto para o Ministério da Educação.  A profissional diz que entrou crua no curso. \"Eu mexia no computador, mas não sabia nem programar. Aí eu corri atrás de cursos para conseguir acompanhar. O começo foi difícil por isso e passei a estudar com conteúdos gratuitos disponíveis na internet\".  Programação, algoritmos, aprendizado de máquina, processamento de áudio e voz, visão computacional e robótica são algumas das matérias que Heloisy aprendeu ao longo da graduação na federal de Goiás.  Embora nem sempre seja possível focar em uma matéria específica durante as aulas, o que pode ser resolvido com projetos complementares da própria universidade, Heloisy diz que o curso conseguiu atender às suas expectativas.  O empreendedorismo, também abordado em sala de aula, foi um diferencial, segundo ela. Tanto que o seu objetivo hoje é empreender com a inteligência artificial.  Por meio de uma iniciativa do Sebrae e da Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa e Inovação Industrial (Embrapii), Heloisy participa de um programa que incentiva talentos da tecnologia a criarem soluções, produtos e serviços para empresas que não têm uma estrutura de TI.  Hoje, ela está prestando serviço para uma companhia de call center que tem sede em Recife (PE). Sua remuneração vem do programa do Sebrae e da Embrapii, mas ela também tem uma participação como sócia no projeto. Ela preferiu não revelar qual é a sua remuneração atual.  \"A gente tem usado IA para deixar o atendimento mais objetivo. Antes mesmo de o atendente falar com o cliente, ele já vai ter todos os dados e até a solução para resolver o problema desse consumidor\", explica.  Heloisy afirma que é abordada por alguns recrutadores no LinkedIn, mas, como ela está empreendendo, muitos desses convites são recusados. Seu objetivo agora é abrir o próprio negócio para, assim como tem feito na companhia de call center, fornecer soluções de IA para outras empresas.  Também para o futuro, ela pensa em fazer uma pós-graduação para ter mais autoridade nesse assunto e até sonha em dar aulas. \"Eu quero muito falar de IA para outras pessoas e também espero que a minha empresa dê certo e que ela possa impactar a vida das pessoas de forma positiva\", conclui.  A recifense Camilly Alves, de 20 anos, era uma que tinha o sonho de estudar medicina, trabalhar em hospital e, no futuro, abrir a sua própria clínica.  Em 2022, ela começou a investir nesse objetivo e começou a cursar enfermagem na Universidade de Pernambuco (UPE), gerida pelo governo estadual.  Enquanto investia na medicina, o seu pai plantava a sementinha da tecnologia da informação (TI) na cabeça dela, dizendo que a área da saúde seria beneficiada pela inovação tecnológica. \"Ele falava isso para me estimular, mas eu acreditava que não era para mim. Eu não sabia nada de TI\".  Em determinado momento, Camilly começou a pesquisar sobre esse ramo. A jovem lembra que começou a ficar curiosa e a fazer várias perguntas. Por exemplo, \"como é possível criar um site?\", questionava ela.  Ainda em 2022, ela resolveu conversar com os pais sobre o desejo de estudar programação. O único problema era conciliar a graduação em enfermagem com o curso de tecnologia. \"Eu tinha que estudar para as provas e fazer trabalhos. Eu não ia conseguir lidar com tudo isso. Felizmente, meus pais entenderam e me apoiaram nessa decisão de sair da medicina.\"  Em novembro daquele ano, Camilly foi atrás de uma instituição de ensino especializada em tecnologia. Ela prestou o vestibular, passou e, sem pensar duas vezes, disse para a família que estava disposta a viver em São Paulo só para estudar.  Camilly se mudou para São Paulo em fevereiro de 2023, aos 19 anos, e mora na casa de familiares junto com o irmão. Ela ainda está cursando IA e deve se formar em dezembro de 2024, mas já vem atuando na área.  No entanto, ela queria colocar em prática o que estava aprendendo no curso de IA. E foi aí que, em julho de 2023, ela se inscreveu no processo seletivo de estágio de um grande banco e passou. Lá, ela é estagiária de ciência de dados, com foco em inteligência artificial aplicada.  Na instituição em que trabalha, Camilly vem cuidando de um modelo que faz previsão de quantas pessoas podem passar em uma agência bancária por dia.  Ao g1, ela conta que está feliz com o caminho que seguiu, mas, às vezes, se assusta com o crescimento acelerado. \"No trabalho, muitos colegas chegam em mim e dizem que eu tenho a responsabilidade de uma pessoa de 30 anos. É muito doido, mas estou adorando\".  Ela preferiu não compartilhar quanto tem recebido no banco, porém afirma que está satisfeita com a bolsa-auxílio ofertada.  Diferente de Camilly, o goiano Heinz Felipe, de 22 anos, não teve o apoio dos pais quando comentou que planejava trocar o curso de engenharia aeroespacial para investir em inteligência artificial.  Junto de Heloisy, Heinz fez parte da primeira turma do curso de graduação de inteligência artificial da Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), que foi lançado em 2020.  No início de 2020, ainda no cursinho, ele ouviu sobre o bacharelado em IA da UFG. \"Eu fui pesquisar mais sobre a área. Vi muitas reportagens, palestras e até descobri que Goiânia é um polo muito forte de inteligência artificial\".  Deu certo e, em 2020, ele foi aprovado na UFG por meio do Sistema de Seleção Unificada (Sisu).  Quando entrou no curso de IA, Heinz lembra que não tinha nenhuma base em tecnologia e nem inglês. \"Essas competências eu fui adquirindo ao longo da graduação, com muitos cursos complementares. Eu estudei ciência da computação, linguagem Python e machine learning\", diz.  Parcerias da UFG com empresas privadas fizeram com que Heinz e outros alunos começassem a ganhar dinheiro enquanto estudavam. Em seu primeiro projeto, em 2021, ele já conseguiu R$ 1.500 desenvolvendo uma solução para a Companhia Paranaense de Energia (Copel).  No segundo projeto, desta vez para uma consultoria de gestão empresarial e de pessoas, foram mais R$ 2.250 para o seu bolso. \"No final da graduação, eu já estava envolvido em dois projetos de IA, ganhando um total de R$ 8 mil\".  Sobre a experiência no bacharelado, Heinz diz que teve medo no início porque não sabia se o \\'hype\\' da IA duraria pouco tempo. Mas, agora, relata que não se arrepende da decisão tomada e reforça que o curso atendeu às suas expectativas.  Heinz ganhou um bolsa de pesquisa para atuar no Centro de Excelência em Inteligência Artificial (Ceia), vinculado à Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG), onde consegue tirar R$ 12 mil por mês.  Ele também está prestando serviço sob demanda para uma empresa do Canadá que desenvolve projetos de inteligência artificial. Lá, ele recebe cerca de R$ 10 mil mensalmente com um contrato PJ.  \"Antes, essa insegurança era duplamente reforçada pelo meu trabalho remoto. Eles não entendiam como eu trabalhava no quarto e ficava o dia todo no computador. Você realmente precisa educar a família para que eles possam entender o seu trabalho, porque acaba sendo uma novidade\", conclui.  LEIA TAMBÉM: '"
